/* 
 * App.css - Custom styles that don't conflict with MUI
 * 
 * This file has been cleaned up to remove:
 * - Hardcoded colors that conflict with theme system
 * - Unused React logo animation styles
 * - Layout styles that are handled by MUI components
 * 
 * Only essential custom styles that complement MUI should be added here.
